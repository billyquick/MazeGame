# MazeGame
A strange take on the first-person shooter genre. Players are equipped with a hand cannon that shoots orbs of energy, but these aren't just any orbs of energy. Players must use these orbs of energy to illuminate the darkness... in a maze... to find the enemy player. 
Did I mention you only have one orb?
